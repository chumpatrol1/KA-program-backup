    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The aim here is to explain some simple Bayesian statistics including examples of how to apply it to cryptography and bioinformatics problems. There will be some quizzes and coding challenges to make things more interesting.</p><p>Hopefully, anyone who knows basic probability will be able to follow along. Watching a few videos in these two tutorials on Khan Academy should be enough to get you started: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/independent-dependent-probability">Independent and dependent probability</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic">Probability and combinatorics</a>. There's also a Pixar in a Box <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/crowds/crowds2/a/lesson-brief-crowds">tutorial on combinations</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Classical Statistics</h2>
    <p>Let's start with a simple warm-up and a classic statistics example: flipping a coin.</p>
    
    <h3>A fair coin</h3>
    <p>If I flip a fair coin twice and get a heads and then a tails, the probability of this result is the probability of getting a heads multiplied by the probability of getting a tails $\frac12 \times \frac12 = \frac14$. We can write the outcome as $HT$ and probability of getting that outcome as $p(HT)$.</p>
    <p>$p(HTHT)$ = <input></p>
    <p><strong>Challenge</strong> Write a function that takes a string of 'H's and 'T's and returns the probability of getting that sequence of heads and tails with a fair coin.</p>
    
    <h3>An unfair coin</h3>
    <p>Now, let's say I have a coin that's weighted so it gets head $70\%$ of the time. Now, $p(HT) = 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21$. We can say, given $p(H) = 0.7, p(HT) = 0.21$.</p>
    <p>Given $p(H) = 0.6, p(HTHT)$ = <input></p>
    <p><strong>Challenge</strong> Write a function that takes a string of 'H's and 'T's and a probability, and returns the chance of getting that sequence of heads and tails with a  coin weighted to come down heads with the given probability.</p>
    
    <h3>Combinations</h3>
    <p>What if we're not interested in the exact sequence of heads and tails we get, just how many of each we get? If we want to find the chance of getting two heads and two tails from four flips, then we need to consider how many combinations of two heads and two tails there are. There are $6$ combinations: <br>$HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH$ <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic/probability_combinatorics/v/getting-exactly-two-heads-combinatorics">See an explanation</a>.</p>
