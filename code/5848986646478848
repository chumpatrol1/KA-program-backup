    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>A couple of months ago I heard a <a href="#bbc-radio-link">radio program</a> about a remarkable woman I'd never heard of before. This contest seems like I good opportunity to learn more about her and share that information. In researching her, I discovered that this year a film will be released about her, with Nicole Kidmann playing the lead role. There was even a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lettersfrombaghdad/letters-from-baghdad-a-film-about-gertrude-bell">kickstarter campaign to make a film about her</a> (in progress). So maybe she will become better known.</p>

        <div class="quote-text">No woman in recent time has combined her qualities – her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency – all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.</div>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <p>Gertrude Bell was born in 19th century Britain, where women were expected to get married, stay at home and devote themselves to domestic chores. Bell instead travelled the world, finding new routes across deserts and up mountains, as well as unearthing new archaeological finds. Her writing and photographs opened up the middle east for the British public.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <div class="quote-mark quote-left">&ldquo;</div>
        <div class="quote-text">[Bell had the opinion that] what applied to other women didn't apply to her.</div>

        <div style="float:right">-- Prof. Helen Berry</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>She came to love Arabia and understand its politics better than any other Westerner. She spent time mixing with tribes and rulers in the middle East, where the freedoms of women were even more limited than in Victorian Britain. Yet she used this to her advantage, gaining political insight from informal conversations.</p>

        <div class="quote-text">Until quite recently I've been wholly cut off from [the Shias] because their tenets forbid them to look upon an unveiled woman and my tenets don't permit me to veil.</div>

        <div class="quote-attribution">-- Gertrude Bell</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>During the first world war, Britain made a series of contradictory promises to various parties in the middle East (as Sal describes <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/history/euro-hist/middle-east-20th-century/v/sykes-picot-agreement-and-the-balfour-declaration">here</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/history/euro-hist/middle-east-20th-century/v/arabia-after-world-war-i">here</a>).
    Bell was one of the people tasked with sorting out the mess, and securing Britain's influence in the oil-rich region. This involved rigging an election to install a weak king loyal to Britain, and creating the modern state of Iraq.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <div class="quote-mark quote-left">&ldquo;</div>
        <div class="quote-text">I'll never engage in creating kings again; it's too great a strain.</div>
        <div class="quote-mark quote-right">&rdquo;</div>
        <div class="quote-attribution">-- Gertrude Bell</div>
    </div>

    <p>The borders of Iraq were set up with little regard to the exisiting religous and tribal boundaries. Much of the trouble in this region that persists to this day is a result of this meddling. So Bell's legacy is not unambiguously positive. However, she seems aware of the issues, and is likely to have done her best for the people there. To this day, she is spoken of fondly by many Iraqis.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Gertrude Bell was the archetypal Victorian explorer, crossing uncharted deserts, climbing unclimbed mountains, and unearthing ancient treasures. She studied the languages, cultures and history of the places she visited, coming to love them, and be loved by their people. While her name is almost unknown in Britain and the English-speaking world, it is spoken with reverence and gratitude by many in the middle East.</p>
