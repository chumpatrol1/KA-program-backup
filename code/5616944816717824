            <p>A common task in computer graphics is to find whether two line segments intersect, and if they do, where. Line segments are defined as a pair of points in 2D or 3D space. Click the image for an interactive program showing where two line segments intersect. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/pixar/line-line-intersection/5505087661539328">Click here</a> for a non-interactive version which makes the steps in the calculation clearer.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>The task can be split into three parts:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>For each pair of points get an equation for a line that passes through both points.</li>
    <li>Solve the simultaneous equations to see where the two lines are equal</li>
    <li>If there is a solution (i.e. the lines are not parallel), test whether the intersection point is on both line segments (not just the lines).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Equations for a line</h2>
    <h3>Slope-intercept form</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to get an equation for a line. The most common is probably <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-linear-equations-functions/8th-slope-intercept-form">slope-intercept form</a>:</p>
    <div class="equation">$y = mx + b$</div>
    <p>where $m$ is the gradient of the line and $b$ is where the line intersects the $y$-axis.</p>
    <p>The problem with slope intercept form is that it doesn't work for all lines. Specifically, it doesn't work for vertical lines: a vertical line has an undefined gradient and doesn't intercept the $y$-axis. So we need another type of equation to represent the lines.</p>
    
    <h3>Parameterised lines</h3>
    <p>A usual way to define a line segement is to parameterise a line, which means introduce a parameter, normally $t$, which defines how far along the line you are. For example, we can define an equation:</p>
    <p>$\qquad P = (1 - t)A + tB$</p>
<p>For every value of $t$ you'll get a point along the line $AB$. For example, when $t = 0, P = A$; when $t = 1, P = B$; when $t = 0.5, P$ is halfway between $A$ and $B$. This is useful for line segments since we can say we're only interested in points where $0 \geq t \geq 1$. We can also rearrange the equation to:</p>
    <p>$\qquad P = A + (B - A)t$</p>
    <p>This is perhaps clearer to understand. It says that we start at point $A$ and move along a vector that starts at $A$ and points to $B$, using $t$ as the proportion of the vector.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/environment-modeling-2/mathematics-of-parabolas2-ver2/v/weighted-average-two-points">Pixar lesson on Environment Modeling</a> explains the concept more clearly.</p>
    
    <h2>Solving simultaneous equations</h2>
    
    <p>Let's say we have four points, $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$, where $A$ has coordinates $(A_x, A_y)$, $B$ has coordinates $(B_x, B_y)$, and so on. Now we want to fine whether line segment $\overline{AB}$ intersects with line segment $\overline{CD}$.</p>
    <p>We start by getting the parameterised equation for each line:</p>
    
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        P_1 &amp;= A + (B - A)t \\
        P_2 &amp;= C + (D - C)s 
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>To find a point that lies on both lines, we set them equal to one another:</p>
    <p>$\qquad A + (B - A)t = C + (D - C)s$</p>
    
    <p>This equation deals with points, but we can split it into two equations dealing with the coordinates of the points:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        A_x + (B_x - A_x)t &amp;= C_x + (D_x - C_x)s \\
        A_y + (B_y - A_y)t &amp;= C_y + (D_y - C_y)s
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>Now we have two equations in two unknowns ($t$ and $s$), so we can solve them. First, we rearrange them:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        (B_x - A_x)t &amp;= C_x - A_x + (D_x - C_x)s \\
        (B_y - A_y)t &amp;= C_y - A_y + (D_y - C_y)s
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>It might now be tempting to divide each side of the first equation by $(B_x - A_x)$ and each side of the second equation by $(B_y - A_y)$, to get them both in terms of $t$. However, then we would be left with the same problem that slope-intersection form gives, namely the equation is undefined when $\overline{AB}$ is vertical (since we are dividing by $B_x - A_x$, which is $0$).</p>
    
    <p>So instead, we multiply the first equation by $(B_y - A_y)$, and the second equation by $(B_x - A_x)$:<p>
    
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        (B_x - A_x)(B_y - A_y)t &amp;= (B_y - A_y)(C_x - A_x + (D_x - C_x)s) \\
        (B_x - A_x)(B_y - A_y)t &amp;= (B_x - A_x)(C_y - A_y + (D_y - C_y)s)
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>The equations are getting a bit messy, so now would be a good time to make some simplifications. Let's define some new constants:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        dx_1 &amp;= B_x - A_x \\
        dy_1 &amp;= B_y - A_y \\
        dx_2 &amp;= D_x - C_x \\
        dy_2 &amp;= D_y - C_y \\
        dx_3 &amp;= C_x - A_x \\
        dy_3 &amp;= C_y - A_y \\
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>Notice that $(dx_1, dy_1)$ is a vector for line segment $\overline{AB}$, $(dx_2, dy_2)$ is a vector for line segment $\overline{CD}$, and $(dx_3, dy_3)$ is a vector from $A$ to $C$.</p>
    
    <p>Now the equation can be written:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        dx_1 \cdot dy_1 \cdot t &amp;= dy_1(dx_3 + dx_2 \cdot s) \\
        dx_1 \cdot dy_1 \cdot t &amp;= dx_1(dy_3 + dy_2 \cdot s)
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>The left-hand side of each equation is equal, so we can set the right-hand sides to be equal:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
    dy_1(dx_3 + dx_2 \cdot s) &amp;= dx_1(dy_3 + dy_2 \cdot s) \\
    dy_1 \cdot dx_3 + dy_1 \cdot dx_2 \cdot s &amp;= dx_1 \cdot dy_3 + dx_1 \cdot dy_2 \cdot s \\
    (dy_1 \cdot dx_2 - dx_1 \cdot dy_2) \cdot s &amp;= dx_1 \cdot dy_3 - dy_1 \cdot dx_3 \\
    s &amp;= \frac{dx_1 \cdot dy_3 - dy_1 \cdot dx_3}{dy_1 \cdot dx_2 - dx_1 \cdot dy_2}
    \end{align}$</p>
    
    <p>Now we have an equation to find the value for $s$, how far along $\overline{CD}$ an intersection is.</p>
    
    <h3>Cross product</h3>
    <p>Notice that our equation has two quite similar terms in the numerator and denominator. In both cases we multiply the $x$ term from one vector with the $y$ term from another, then subtract the $y$ term from the first vector multiplied by the the $x$ term from the second. This operator is the the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/dot_cross_products/v/linear-algebra-cross-product-introduction">cross product</a> of two vectors.</p>
    <p>Notice too that the denominator of our equation is $dy_1 \cdot dx_2 - dx_1 \cdot dy_2$. We have gone to quite a lot of effort to avoid having zero in the denominator - will this expression ever equal zero, and if so when?</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        dy_1 \cdot dx_2 - dx_1 \cdot dy_2 &amp;= 0 \\
        dy_1 \cdot dx_2 &amp;= dx_1 \cdot dy_2 \\
        \frac{dy_1}{dx_1} &amp;= \frac{dy_2}{dx_2}
    \end{align}$</p>

    <p>So our $s$ term will be undefined when gradient of $\overline{AB}$ equals the gradient of $\overline{CD}$. That makes sense because when the gradients are equal, the lines are either parallel or aligned. Either way, there is no meaningful intersection point.</p>
    
    <h2>Getting the final answer</h2>
    
    <p>Now we have calculated $s$, we first check whether $0 \geq s \geq 1$. If not, then the "intersection" occurs on a point not on $\overline{CD}$ (but it is on the <strong>line</strong> that passes through points $C$ and $D$). Then we can plug $s$ into either of the following equations to find $t$:</p>
    <p>$\qquad \begin{align}
        A_x + (B_x - A_x)t &amp;= C_x + (D_x - C_x)s \\
        A_y + (B_y - A_y)t &amp;= C_y + (D_y - C_y)s
    \end{align}$</p>
    <p>Note that if $\overline{AB}$ is veritcal, then $(B_x - A_x) = 0$, so in the first equation, the $t$ term disappears; in that case, use the second equation. Likewise, if the line in horizontal, you will have to use the first equation.</p>
    <p>Once you have $t$, you check whether $0 \geq t \geq 1$, and if it is, then you do have an intersection. Finally, you can plug with $s$ or $t$ into one of the parameterised line equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point.</p>
