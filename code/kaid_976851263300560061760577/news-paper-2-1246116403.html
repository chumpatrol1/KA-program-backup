That\'s what we would find out. \n\n//As we delve deeper into the subject, we find that programs with buttons tend to have more votes than the ones without. So, the answer to the question above is buttons. Here you would expect to end the article, but we haven\'t finished our adventure yet.\n\n//Buttons are a sign of great skill. If you know how mouseX and mouseY work, you should be off and running. But buttons are tricky to master. You must be sure where they start and end. Even I, who now use lots of buttons, make a mistake here or there. Some people just give up, but the legendary people who made your games would not give up. \n\n//How are buttons good for games? They make the \"Play\",\"Instructions\",\"Options\" and \"Credits\" buttons. No game is complete without them! But it doesn\'t only go for the splash page (The starting screen on the game). It actually gets into the game play sometimes (As in the polular Scruffs finding game). \n\n//Buttons are also good if you are making a site with javascript. Don\'t believe it? Try the buttons on the canvas!\n\n//David Elijah de Siqueira Campos McLaughlin\n\n//Buttons courtesy of Michael\n\n//variables\nvar menu = true;\nvar credits = false;\nvar instructions = false;\nvar
