<p>DNA is the abbreviation of deoxyribonucleic acid. It refers to any molecule formed by joining together units called nucleotides in chain. There are four standard nucleotides, called <strong>adenine</strong>, <strong>cytosine</strong>, <strong>guanine</strong> and <strong>thymine</strong>. These can be joined together in any order to form chains, which can reach hundreds of millions of units long. So there are an unimaginably huge number of possible DNA molecules, more than there are atoms in the universe (by a long way).</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>When the nucleotides form a chain, part of their structure (called the nucleobase, or more simply, base) sticks out from the chain. If two chains come together, the bases from one chain can stick to the bases from the other, forming doubled-stranded DNA. When this happens, DNA forms the iconic <strong>double helix</strong>. However, not all bases stick to one another: adenine will only bind with thymine (and visa versa), and cytosine will only bind with guanine (and visa versa). When two strands have exactly the right sequence to allow them to bind with each other, they are said to be <strong>complementary</strong>.</p>

<p>Because each&nbsp;base&nbsp;only binds one other&nbsp;base, if you know the sequence of bases on one strand of DNA, you can work out the sequence of bases on the other. This allows double-stranded DNA to be replicated: the two strands separate and a complementary&nbsp;strand is created to match each one, resulting in two double-stranded DNA molecules, each with the same pair of&nbsp;sequences as the original one.</p>
