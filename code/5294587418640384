<p>Most <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/cells/eukaryotic-cells">eukaryotic</a> genes do not exist as a continuous sequence of nucleotides. Instead the coding sequence is split up into sections called <strong>exons</strong>. These exons are separated by non-coding regions called <strong>introns</strong>. When a gene is expressed&nbsp;its full length, including all the&nbsp;introns, is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/dna/v/transcription-1">transcribed</a> into messenger RNA (mRNA). But before the mRNA is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/dna/v/protein-translation-1">translated</a>, the intron are removed in a process called <strong>splicing</strong>.</p>

<p>In splicing, the end of one exon is joined to the beginning of a second exon, and the RNA in between the two is cut out and degraded. Most commonly this will mean that the end of one exon will be joined to the end of the following exon. For example, <em>exon 1</em> will be joined to <em>exon 2</em>. However, in some cases <em>exon 1</em> might get joined to <em>exon 3</em>, and <em>exon 2</em> will be discarded. In other cases, an intron might not be spliced out at all, or the middle of <em>exon 1</em> might be joined to the beginning of <em>exon 2</em>, so the end of <em>exon 1</em> is removed.</p>

<p>The advantage of splicing is that it gives organisms the opportunity to create a much greater diversity of proteins, for example, having slightly different copies of a protein in different tissue types. Before the human genome was sequence, it was predicted that we would have about 100,000 genes. Scientists were surprised to discover the number was closer to 20,000. However, about 35% of human genes are predicted to undergo alternative splicing, with some genes able to generate dozens of different of protein variants (isoforms).</p>

<p>Alternative splicing allows organisms to build proteins in a modular way, a bit like using LEGO bricks. For example, a gene may include an exon that codes for a section of protein that has a specific function&nbsp;(this sort of protein part is&nbsp;is&nbsp;called a domain). One domain might&nbsp;allow&nbsp;another protein to bind to it and so stop the protein&nbsp;with that domain carrying out its normal function. By including an exon with that domain, the cell will make a protein that can be regulated. Alternatively, by splicing out that exon, the cell&nbsp;will make a protein that functions uninterrupted. Other domains might cause the protein to be sent to the nucleus, or to the mitochondria, allowing cells to target essentially the same protein&nbsp;to different organelles. By using&nbsp;alternative splicing, organism can efficiently fine-tune the proteins they make.</p>
